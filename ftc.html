      <p>I competed in FTC during 2016, 2017, and 2018. While each year taught me invaluable lessions, both about engineering and teamwork, 2017 was truly special. The 2017 game was "Velocity Vortex" - a game where your robot had to shoot baskets, collect small plastic balls, and capture a yoga ball. The wide variety of feasible strategies in the game made the year especially exciting, as optimizing any one part of the game could be worth enough points for you to win. Our team, 6990, made it all the way to the worlds quarter finals, in Houston. In addition to our strong showing on the field, we also received a THINK nomination (top 10) for our team engineering notebook. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate what we learned in 2017 is through that notebook, which you can find linked below. FIRST and FTC helped me meet wonderful mentors and engineers, and I wouldn't be half the engineer I am today without it.</p>
