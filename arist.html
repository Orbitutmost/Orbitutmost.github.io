      <p>This internship involved a team of interns working on a proof of concept robotic kiosk design, to bring it from one-off pitch models to a version with improved reliability and manufacturability. My role was primarily investigating the required electronics for the product, as well as CAD design for various internal and external components. The electronics work involved tear-downs of a variety of existing robotics chassis solutions to learn from their board and component choices. Batteries, sensor placement, power management boards, and motor choice were all areas of investigation. My primary CAD contributions involved designing internal mounting structures for the “head” of the robot, as well as the external shell. This design task was especially interesting as it was concerned with ergonomics, manufacturing, and mechanical structure.</p>
