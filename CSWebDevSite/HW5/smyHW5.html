            <h3>Continuing Pandemic Pushes Prices Lower in West Campus</h3>
            <p>As we enter our 12th month of the <abbr title="SARS-CoV-2">covid-19</abbr> pandemic, the loss of on campus students continues to push West Campus housing providers to lower their prices! Just kidding; massive groups like American Campus have plenty of money to wait out even a year long pandemic. It seems extremely likely they will lower their asking price any time soon, as lowering prices even temporarily makes it much harder to continue raising them later. Mom-and-pop shops, however, have likely been hit hard by the current lack of on-campus activity. Many of these appartments, already suffering from pressure to sell their land to big investors, may find this the final straw to sell. As we lose these alternatives to big-box housing, prices in West Campus are likely to continue to climb. <a href="smyHW5dummy.html">Click here to continue reading.</a></p>
            <h3>Highly Anticipated Seminar Gives Hard Truths</h3>
            <p>The central point of “Sleeping Your Way to Academic Success“, the <abbr title="University Lecture Series">ULS</abbr> talk given by Dr. Carter, was that adequate sleep is important, and you are not your best when you lack sleep. She discussed why sleep mattered to our bodies, how much we needed, and ways to get more sleep with more efficiency. Her main point, however, was that we are not at our peak when we are sleep deprived, and we often don’t see it. Dr. Carter presented studies that showed that when we lack sleep, we are more irritable, only remember bad emotions, and lose up to 40% efficiency in learning. Those points can be hard to stomach, because when we lack sleep, we also lose the ability to judge our own abilities or how impaired we are. <a href="smyHW5dummy.html">Click here to continue reading.</a></p>

            <h3>Boating Association Issues Warning</h3>
            <p>The Austin Boating Association (<abbr title="Austin Boating Association">ABA</abbr>) has issued a warning about boating at night after a series of colisions over the last month. Most of the collisions have occured between motorboats and small craft, like jetskis or canoes. While there have been no deaths, there has obviously been property damage that could've been avoided. As such, the orgianization warns boaters to avoid sailing after the sun sets, unless equiped with clear warning lights and markers. Although the orgnization has no legal power to enforce this guidance, it just makes common sense. Driving a boat while you can't see where you're going is clearly a bad idea. Additionally, they have advised that no drinking take place if the boat plans on moving after sundown. <a href="smyHW5dummy.html">Click here to continue reading.</a> <br /></p>

            <p>With more Austinites working from home, more people are free to watch the sunrise! As a result, local media has seen increased coverage of the spectacular mornings the sky above Austin treats us to! The central point of “Sleeping Your Way to Academic Success“, the ULS talk given by Dr. Carter, was that adequate sleep is important, and you are not your best when you lack sleep.

            <h3>Construction Continues in West Campus</h3>
            <p>No end in sight for building in West Campus. Despite the brief respite given by the harsh freeze of the last two weeks, students are once again being awoken at 7am to the sound of jackhammers as construction on numerous complexes continues. The Austin Boating Association (<abbr title="Austin Boating Association">ABA</abbr>) has issued a warning about boating at night after a series of colisions over the last month.
